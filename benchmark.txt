What do we measure?
    Solving time/ search space for different audio varying
    * time domain
    * frequency domain
    * character
    * mono vs. stereo
    to look at time scaling for input length. 
    We will look in clingo at:
        Choice
        Conflicts
        Constraints
        Rules 
        Time stats (cpu, solving)

What do I have to do?
    Search for interesting, reproducable, objective audio
    and setting that give us valuable insights into ASP

Which specs do I have to clarify?
    * environment
    * cpu
    * ram 
    with at least 3 runs on the same machine and different machine

This will give us:
    How solving time scales with signal complexity and signal length
    How the search space grows
    How many solutions are found
    How problem size changes
    Performance bottlenecks


Simple and Complex in isolation:
* duration vs time solving 
* amp vs time solving

Decide on how to implement the iteration:
    - iterate over frequencies in durations or vice versa?
    - iterate over durations in amps or vice versa? (probably best -> We have to seperate frequencies)
    - iterate over frequencies in amps or vice versa?
