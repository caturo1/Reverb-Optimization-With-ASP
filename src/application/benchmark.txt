What do we measure?
    Solving time/ search space for different audio varying
    * time domain
    * frequency domain
    * character
    * mono vs. stereo
    to look at time scaling for input length. 
    We will look in clingo at:
        Time
        CPU Time
        Choice
        Conflicts
        Rules 
        Constraints

What do I have to do?
    Search for interesting, reproducable, objective audio
    and setting that give us valuable insights into ASP

Which specs do I have to clarify?
    * environment
    * cpu
    * ram 
    with at least 3 runs on the same machine and different machine
