# Reverb-Optimization-With-ASP
Code and misc for my bachelor thesis "ASP in audio effect processing for optimizing reverb parameters"

The code still is very messy, but you can invoke the program by just running the src\feature_extraction\parameter_optimization.py file with

'python parameter_optimization.py'
