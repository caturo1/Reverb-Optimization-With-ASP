# Reverb-Optimization-With-ASP
Code and misc for my bachelor thesis "ASP in audio effect processing for optimizing reverb parameters"

The code still is very messy and I will eventually refactor everything, but you can invoke the program by just running the src\feature_extraction\parameter_optimization.py file with

```
cd src\feature_extraction
python parameter_optimization.py
```
