# Reverb-Optimization-With-ASP
Code and misc for my bachelor thesis "Digital Signal Processing with ASP: Optimizing Audio Parameters of a Reverb Effect"

OUTDATED:
The code still is very messy and I will eventually refactor everything, but you can invoke the program by just running the src\feature_extraction\parameter_optimization.py file with

```
cd src/feature_extraction
python parameter_optimization.py
```
